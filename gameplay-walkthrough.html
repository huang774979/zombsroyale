					Preface
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					I will split the game into 5 phases. Phase 1 is the beginning 30-60 seconds where everybody is just scrambling to get loot and where you likely to die if not quick enough. Phase 2 is when around 20-30 players remain. A few players may be bad, but most players are decent if not pro. Phase 3 is when less 10 players remain. A popup will say 10 players remaining. Almost all players in Phase 3 are good. Phase 4 is the final 3 or 4 players. You will have to fight really hard to get past phase 4. Phase 5 is a one on one. At this phase, it is the final fight. Whoever&rsquo;s weapon is better will most likely win.&nbsp;<br>Now that I have explained how this will work, let&rsquo;s get started.&nbsp;

					Phase 1
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. Always check the map by pressing m when in the lobby to see the path the plane will go.&nbsp;<br>2. Always jump before you see a building to loot because you take some time to get to the ground.&nbsp;<br>3. If the plane starts (the dot) with an area like faraway farm or tinker town with plenty of small buildings, spamming space to jump early and holding space to freefall quickly can be a good tactic.&nbsp;<br>4. If you see someone else who is lower than you (the white or blue bar above them will show) go for crates near the building.&nbsp;<br>5. Players that are “glitching” who open doors but don&rsquo;t take loot are bots. Kill them for extra damage and xp.&nbsp;<br>6. During this phase, it&rsquo;s best to not drink big shields but if you find small shields, drink them in a safe spot.&nbsp;<br>7. Fight aggresively during this phase.&nbsp;

					Phase 2
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. Do not fight too aggresively as you will lose hp for the rest of the phases.&nbsp;<br>2. Always fight someone if they have a minigun. Most likely, they are beginners, so lead them into houses or places where you have an advantage. However, if they also use snipers or other weapons, they could be good.&nbsp;<br>3. If you are in a house or a bush and you see two other good players fighting, wait until one has killed the other and has started to heal. Then, kill the remaining one aggresively. You have a higher chance of winning with third party kills.&nbsp;<br>4. If you see a player healing, it is always best to not let them heal and fight them if you have a lot of hp.&nbsp;<br>5. A good strategy is to stand on the border of the gas for a while and see if any players appear. If they do, let them come out of the gas then kill them aggresively so you can take their loot without loosing hp.&nbsp;<br>6. It&rsquo;s usually good to stop if you hear other players moving and follow them to have the advantage.&nbsp;<br>7. Go for airdrops in this phase as more unexperienced players tend to go for airdrops while pros already have very good weapons.&nbsp;<br>

					Phase 3
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. In this phase, you must play really hard since everybody is already very good and have good loot.&nbsp;<br>2. Always go for third party kills in this phase, you will benefit more.&nbsp;<br>3. If you see someone with a flexible weapon such as a cactus grenade, gassy grenade, or rubber gun, move out of any building and you will not be disadvantaged.&nbsp;<br>4. You should drop medkits over bandages since quick healing is needed for the next 2 phases.&nbsp;<br>5. If you see a big shield, drink it even if you have 99 shield hp as it could mean your victory later on in the game.&nbsp;<br>6. Play very aggresively towards the end of this phase.&nbsp;<br>7. Make sure you have the best loot towards the start of phase 4.&nbsp;

					Phase 4
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. In this phase, you must play your very best.&nbsp;<br>2. A trolley kind of strategy is to use reverse inpulses to pull the other 2 players together to make them fight.&nbsp;<br>3. If you see the other 2 players are teaming, it is best to try to make them accidentally damage each other.&nbsp;<br>4. Drink hybrid potions as they can give you up to 50 hp in total.&nbsp;<br>5. Try to deduce what weapons your 2 opponents have to decide whether you want to fight in the open or in a house.&nbsp;<br>6. Gassy grenades can be useful to give you time to heal.&nbsp;<br>7. If one player dies and they have hybrid potions or good weapons, it is worth going for it to have a higher chance in phase 5.&nbsp;

					Phase 5
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					The endgame is littered with fully-stacked players, some carrying powerful Airdrop weapons. However, the gas circle can give advantages to many different weapon ranges depending on where it is. If it circles in on Blossom Burbs, Lucky Lake or Tinker Town, SMGs have an advantage in the sense that they can skirt through houses and corners for easy killings. If it circles in on Faraway Farm, Wild West, Radical Reef, ARs can easily use their superior range and fire rate to clear obstacles and shoot enemies in the same clip. Anywhere else gives Snipers a clear lane of fire and no place to hide - what more do they need to absolutely destroy everyone? You can go through walls (intended feature) by throwing impulses at yourself and then moving towards the wall in question. you can also pull others and yourself together by using the reverse impulses. This can be combed with Grenades to make a deadly weapon!
