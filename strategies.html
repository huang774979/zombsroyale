					Survival Strategies
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. Land far away from the plane.<br>2. Avoid where people go.<br>3. Be the first one to loot.<br>4. You only need a few weapons; save room for Medkits, Bandages and Potions.<br>5. You can get more ammo by switching your weapon with one on the ground and then switching back. You don't have to rely on ammo on the ground. This is really useful as most guns on the ground will have 30 ammo in them, and that adds up.<br>6. Don't be greedy for loot unless it's worth it.<br>7. When you're low on bullets, don't attack people if they don't have the loot you want.<br>8. Only switch weapons using number keys or scroll wheel. Never click on the weapon in your weapon slot.&nbsp;<br>9. When being attacked go to the other side of the bullets and run around the shooter. (If you're being shot from the left move left to the source) you may get hit more than once but at least they'll have to aim again and you have time to shoot back. [May not be a good strategy when you are low on shield and health]<br>10. If you see crates in the gas (except golden and ammo crates), shoot them and see if the loot inside is worth losing health for.<br>11. When running away from a better player, hide in houses. It buys time to quickly use a few bandages, and forces the attacker to change their strategy from long-range to short-range. Plus, some houses may have leftover loot that you can probably use.<br>12. A house with two doors is always better than a house with one. It grants an escape plan when things go sideways.Three is even better!<br>13. Wear a basic cosmetic (skin). Don't wear a high skill skin if you are trying to have a low profile but also don't do full default, people will go for you thinking you're an easy target.<br>14. Always try to stay away from a fight. If you hear bullets, it's best to hide or go the other direction.<br>15. If you're going in small huts(1 door) ensure no one is around, otherwise, they will think you are an easy target and will start attacking you.<br>16. Medkits, Bandages, and Power Potions take time to consume, so look around to ensure nobody is around then you can use it.<br>17. If you see 2 strong players fighting, stay away and hide in houses. After they killed each other/either one of them survived but weakened, charge out to finished the weakened player off, and go grab the loot you need.&nbsp;

					Kill Strategies
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. Pumps are wonderful because you can deal a lot of damage, but they require some skill to use effectively.<br>2. Try to use a Pump Shotgun if you have one, while at close range.<br>3. At long range it is best to use a sniper rifle.<br>4. Try to dodge bullets when fighting, move back and forth and try to find cover, don't hold still or you'll get shot. And die.<br>5. In Duos or Squads, your friend can revive you. Don't run from players with nametags, they are on your team.<br>6. Don't extend your peaks, they allow enemies to shoot you.<br>7. Be careful not to kill yourself with a RPG.&nbsp;<br>8. Hiding inside of houses is often riddled with risks. Trapping yourself in an enclosed area where the enemy can take cover while you can't? Never open the door unless you have a plan. And hug the walls - usually hiding in houses allow a brief moment of stall to get in that hybrid or small shield, and standing near window for easy shots kinda defeats that purpose.<br>9. Have guns for short, mid and long range battles. A good combination is a shotgun or SMG for close range, an Assault Rifle for mid range, and a Sniper for long range.<br>10. Snipe at everyone you see, sometimes you can clean up an unsuspecting player by doing this. This gives you free loot to utilise, and grants you an elimination<br>11 Tag airdrops on your map. (Press M and click anywhere on the map to place a marker.) This allows you to locate the coveted airdrop weapon, even if it's been taken - you simply need to hunt the person who took it around the area where you put a marker.<br>12. Preferably use WASD. It makes it a lot easier when picking up loot, grabbing chests/crates, and makes it easier to shoot.<br>13. To rack up some easy kills, have a RPG , a Rare or higher shotgun, or a Flamethrower and go to a hut, and shoot people who look in. That racks up to easy kills. Just pay attention to the gas.<br>14. Always pick up a Bolt-Action Sniper. They pack quite a punch, and are good for easier finishes.<br>15. Pumps might seem pretty good, but it slows your speed down. Only use pumps when in close range, and if the opponent moves out of the range, then switch to an AR or SMG. (It's better to use pumps when in a building or your opponent is in one.)<br>16. If you have a Bolt-Action Sniper, try to lure a opponent that doesn't see you by sniping the player. If he doesn't die and he is shooting you, try run away from the gunfire and at the same time, hide in the trees. Once the player come close enough, pull out a short-ranged weapon (SMG or Shotgun) and come close to him. Then you'll have the advantage to shoot him down with a close range weapon.<br>17. During the end games use fast firing weapons to prevent others from being able to safely enter the circle, This means that the enemy will have to find another entrance or run through your stream of bullets. This works more when in squads however is still useful in solos and duos.<br>18. Order your weapons in a way that you remember. The last slots take longer to switch to. This will let you easily take out an enemy. It is better to keep healing items in your last slot, since you only want to use healing items when you are safe.<br>19. When playing with a Squad, make sure everyone has a fast-firing weapon. If 4 streams of bullets are constantly firing at an enemy, it is almost impossible to survive.<br>20. If the enemy is behind a door and you both have a shotgun, be the one to open the door. Rapidly press fire right after you open the door. This lets you get the first shot in.<br>21. In all modes use a Sniper to look for other players fighting. When one of them dies and the other starts healing, snipe the person and switch to a fast firing weapon to finish them off. This is especially effective if you jump near the beginning(not recommended) or if you are one of the last survivors.<br>22. When you are stuck inside a building from both sides, leaving you no exit, use impulses to escape safely and take minimal damages.<br>23. If you saw someone pinking up a crate in the gas, better finish them off as it might be a threat to you.&nbsp;<br>

					Advanced Strategies
				</h3>
				<p class="mx-auto d-block">
					1. DO NOT USE THIS METHOD IF YOU ARE NOT A SKILLED PLAYER. This is an instakill method if you do it right. Only works at about short to mid range. Weapons you need: Bolt-action sniper, epic or above, and a pump shotgun, preferably a legendary. But if you get every bullet in, a epic one will work too. Also you need an impulse grenade. Throw a impulse based on where your enemy is, then snipe them. When you land right next to the enemy, use your pump shotgun to shoot them. This should result in one dead player even if they have full health and shield. If you have a epic Bolt-action sniper and a epic pump shotgun, your best result is a perfect 200 damage insta-kill. (Method invented by Orca#1011).&nbsp;<br>2. Shoot with your sniper first to deal damage, then quickly switch to your AK to deal more damage, then use impulses and SMGs/Shotguns to finish them off.&nbsp;<br>3. It's a good idea to arrange you weapons. It provides for easier and faster switching and prevents unintended mishaps (switching to an RPG and blowing yourself up by accident when you wanted an SMG). Try sorting them by range, from far to short or the other way around. A tip for scrollers - this arrangement suits you best as you can simply scroll upwards or downwards from your Sniper to your AR if the enemy is close enough.<br>4.It's best to carry only three weapons and two miscellaneous items (it can still be weapons). One Sniper, one AR and one SMG or Shotgun for the weapons, and a stack of Bandages and Hybrid Potions. Of course, it all varies - an RPG in place of the Sniper or a miscellaneous slot is good for dealing with the hectic race for the Airdrop; its heavy splash damage is nifty too. Grenades, any kind, can provide tactical advantages that win you games. You could even drop the AR and go for a Sniper/SMG/Grenade/Grenade/Healing set if you have confidence in your skills.<br>5. The Medium-Range gun is what you'll switch to for most fights. When fighting in medium range Strafe to confuse your enemies whilst still utilising the cover provided. If you find The "Mythics" (scoped M4, Assault scar, Suppressed Ar-15) Be sure to pick them up as they are the best weapons available.<br>6. The Shotgun is what you'll switch to while inside houses. It is a good for close up battles. Also great for killing knocked down players, go right next to them and shoot for great damage. Pump Shotguns offer a large, dense spray of bullets, Tactical Shotguns sacrifice density of bullets for range (as such, each bullet does more damage) and Assault Shotguns have a tight spread and far range, making it useful even outdoors.<br>
